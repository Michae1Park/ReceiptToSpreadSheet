My three other roomates and I often go grocery shopping to HEB or Costco.
We buy a bunch of food and some apartment maintenance utilities, which we separate the cost if we choose to share.
We use a google spreadsheet to keep track of items bought and costs, but someone has to enter 100 or so items everytime.
This app will take preprocessed image of HEB or Costco recipt, parse it using OCR, and punch in the itmes and prices to our spreadsheet.
Hopefully this app will alleviate the PAIN of dull "Data Entry" job.
